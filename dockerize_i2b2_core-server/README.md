# In Development

To start core-server, provide the following:

    * i2b2.war
    * JDBC .jar file(s) for database connectivity
    * crc-ds.xml
    * ont-ds.xml
    * pm-ds.xml
    * work-ds.xml

Choose JDBC jar file(s) according to file specified in .xml files

One place where binary distribution can be found is official i2b2 page https://www.i2b2.org/software/index.html

N.B. Currently database is not provided automatically, and relies on correct .xml configuration and created structure
